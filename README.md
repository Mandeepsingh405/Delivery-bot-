Title of the Project:

ON CAMPUS DELIVERY BOT.

 
Abstract:

In response to the growing demand for efficient and versatile autonomous delivery systems, this project introduces an Arduino Uno-based smart car designed for the delivery of goods in diverse environments. The smart car offers four distinct operational modes: Line Following, IR Remote Control, Voice Commands, and Obstacle Avoidance, combining to create a multifunctional and adaptable platform for streamlined delivery tasks.For manual control and flexibility, the IR Remote Control mode allows users to navigate the delivery car using a standard infrared remote controller. This enables human intervention when necessary, especially in situations requiring fine-tuned adjustments or human judgment.
The integration of voice recognition technology allows users to control the smart car through voice commands, making it an accessible and user-friendly option for hands-free operation. This feature is particularly beneficial when the vehicle needs to interact with a human operator or be directed remotely. Obstacle Avoidance mode equips the delivery car with sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles in real-time. This capability ensures the safety and efficiency of the delivery process, especially when dealing with unforeseen obstructions or dynamic environments. This Arduino Uno-based smart car exemplifies the potential of open-source microcontrollers and sensor integration in addressing real-world challenges. By providing a combination of these four distinct modes, the smart delivery car offers a versatile solution for a wide range of delivery scenarios, organization, like logistics, healthcare, e-commerce, and more. This project underscores the adaptability and innovation made possible through the integration of technology in delivery services

To allow autonomous transport vehicles to be used for transportation tasks in large-scale outdoor environments proven approaches from the robotics domain needs to be applied and transferred to these new environments. In this paper, we present an integrated autonomous transport vehicle which addresses these problems and is able to deliver parcels in urban environments such as city centers automatically. The developed transport vehicle is based on a commercial electrical personal vehicle. It was adapted for autonomous control and equipped with improved navigation skills for outdoor environments based on a topological navigation approach. The integrated vehicle was evaluated in realistic delivery use cases where parcels are delivered autonomously to addresses in a larger urban area. The main contributions of this paper are the adaptation of well-known algorithms for robot navigation for large-scale urban environments, an integration of these algorithms in a commercially available electrical vehicle, the improvement of the robustness of the approach by integrating additional from OpenStreetMap (OSM), and an evaluation of the autonomous delivery concept in real urban environments such as an university campus or a city center.

The field of autonomous robots is growing rapidly in the world, in terms of both the diversity of emerging applications and the levels of interest among traditional players in the automotive, truck, public transportation, industrial, and military communities. Autonomous robotic systems offer the potential for significant enhancements in safety and operational efficiency. Due to the meteoric growth of e- commerce, developing faster, more affordable and sustainable last-mile deliveries become more important. In this paper, Autonomous robot including the cyber physical architecture of the robots as well as the renderings of CAD models are illustrated. Designing new solutions including catadioptric cameras that output panoramic views of the scene, i.e., images with very large fields of view. It describes the problem of state estimation and localization of a robot in detail. In order to navigate accurately around the world, the robot 
must know its location in the world and the map exactly. A robot can move smoothly only if it is properly localized. An inaccurate localization may cause the robot to vary on the roads or behave erroneously which are serious issues when the robot is completely autonomous.
